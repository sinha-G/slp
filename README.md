<h1> Slippi Data Analysis </h1>

<h2> Milestones </h2>

Some of the highlights from the work so far are:
* Fox-Sheik Binary Classification from their Inputs with >99% Accuracy
* Top-5 Character Multi Classification from their Inputs with >99% Accuracy
* Classify Fox's opponent from Fox's inputs Binary Classification with >65% Accuracy

<h2> To Do: </h2>

A rough list of tasks, models, and ideas we hope to pursue:
* Autoencoder training
* RNN
* Transformers (built from scratch?)
* Add raw_analog_x feature if UCF
* Classify stage from inputs
* Predict winner from first t seconds
* Explainability

<h2> Research Questions </h2>

We're guided by the following questions:
* What correlates with winning? Positioning? L-cancelling? APM?
